Hi!
This is my first react project.

It's a TLOZ Breath Of The Wild encyclopedia with all the Hyrule Compendium Entries.
It includes a live filter by entry number or name.

I created it during Globant's 2021 React Bootcamp as a final project.

For me it's a proof of concept of the things I've learned in the last month,
but also a way to combine the joy i get on learning and gaming.

Unfortunately, on this first version, it works on mobile only requesting the desktop site.

Hopefully I can find the time to improve it and use it in my next playthrough :)

Special thanks to Globant's tutors and bootcamp mates!

Work hard... but never stop playing.
Leinner.
