Hi!
This is my first react project.

I created it during Globant's 2021 React Bootcamp as a final project.

For me it's a proof of concept of the things I've learned in the last month,
but also a way to combine the joy i get on learning and gaming.

Unfortunately on the first version it works on mobile only in desktop mode.

Hopefully I can find the time to improve it and use it in my next playthrough :)

Special thanks to Globant's tutors and bootcamp mates!

Work hard... but never stop playing.
Leinner.
